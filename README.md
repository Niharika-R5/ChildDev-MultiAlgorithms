# ChildDev-MultiAlgorithms
Overview
Early identification of developmental delays and disorders in children is vital for timely intervention and optimal outcomes. This research presents a predictive model that assesses cognitive development by analyzing early-life factors such as demographic information, pregnancy-related factors, and parental characteristics.

Key Features
Predictive Focus: Emotional, visual, listening responses, verbal communication, intellectual response, and more.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes decision trees, deep neural networks (DNN), autoencoders, MLP regressors, XGBoost, gradient boosting, and support vector machines (SVM).
Developmental Disorders: Examines Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), and Anxiety Disorders.
